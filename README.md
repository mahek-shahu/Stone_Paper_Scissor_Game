# Stone_Paper_Scissor_Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Stone-Paper-Scissor game using Python. The game is played between two players, where each player chooses one of the three options (Stone, Paper, or Scissor) simultaneously.

The outcome of the game is decided by comparing the choices made by both players as follows:

Stone beats Scissor
Scissor beats Paper
Paper beats Stone
If both players choose the same option, the game is a tie.
